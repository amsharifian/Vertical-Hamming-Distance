Many mechanisms have been proposed to efficiently calculate the edit-distance of strings and filter out incorrect mappings. These mechanisms can be divided into five main classes: (i) dynamic programming (DP) algorithms, (ii) SIMD implementations of DP algorithms, (iii) bit-vector implementations of DP algorithms, (iv) Hamming distance calculation, and (v) locality-based filtering mechanisms. For instance \cite{swps3} uses approach ii, \cite{seqan} uses iii approach, fastHASH\cite{fasthash} uses v approach. The nearest approach to VHD which uses bit-parallelism and SIMD instructions to achieve better performance is Shifted Hamming Distance\cite{shd}.
