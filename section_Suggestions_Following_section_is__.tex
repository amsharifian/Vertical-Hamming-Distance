\section{Suggestions}

Following section is description of three suggestions about future works.

\subsection{Changing alphabet size}
Till now size of the alphabet was four ($\Sigma = \{A,C,G,T\}$) but can increase size of our alphabet by coding two characters instead of one character. By coding two characters our alphabet would change to:

\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\Sigma = \{ AA, AC, AG, AT, \dots, TC, TG, TT \}
\end{equation}
