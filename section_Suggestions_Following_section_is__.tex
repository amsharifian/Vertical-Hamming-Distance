\section{Suggestions}

Following section is description of three suggestions about future works.

\subsection{Changing alphabet size}
Till now size of the alphabet was four ($\Sigma = \{A,C,G,T\}$) but can increase size of our alphabet by coding two characters instead of one character. By coding two characters our alphabet would change to:

\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\Sigma = \{ AA, AC, AG, AT, \dots, TC, TG, TT \}
\end{equation}

Following coding schema imposes multiple changes on our previous schema:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data would compress. For instance if previous that our read's length was 100 we had to save 100 coded for each character but now, we can save 50 codes.
\item Our code length would increase. 
\end{enumerate}
